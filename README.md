# Diet Recommendation Tool

## goal
Project to extract data from the UN FAO and publish on a website

## background
The UN has long hosted with Food and Agriculture Organisation a corpus of detail around food properties particularly to help assist in under nourished contries to manage amino acid intake to calculate the ability to develop muscle. I want to use this data to create a website that will make it easy to calculate how which proteins a person has injested and importantly recommend other food to eat to make up a deficit of missing proteins.

## method
Extract Amino Acid data from FAO.org (1st draft completed)
Covert to readable construct for Python (1st draft completed)
Need to revalidate the data with a dietition and update downloaded data and plan website calculations.
Publish on website, including aggregation and recommendation tools (Next)

Run Extraction method: cd ./app; ./src/extract.py
